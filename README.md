\item {Occupation title} {Occupations in United Kingdom, that data is available on the variables of Proximity to others and Exposure to disease.}

\item {Proximity to others} {Each occupation's physical proximity, that data is available on the variables of Proximity to others and Exposure to disease.}

\item {Exposure to disease} {Each occupation’s exposure to Covid-19, that data is available on the variables of Proximity to others and Exposure to disease.} 

\item {Percentage of the workforce that are female (%)} {Percentage of female workforce in each occupation, that data is available on the variables of Proximity to others and Exposure to disease.}

\item{ Percentage of the workforce that are aged 55+ (%)}{Percentage of the workforce that are aged 55 and above in each occupation, that data is available on the variables of Proximity to others and Exposure to disease.}

•Other- 
* Proximity to others is a variable from the O*NET database about the context in which people work, with a value of 0 to 100.

* The standardized physical proximity measure is defined by:

* 0 – I do not work near other people (beyond 100 ft.)
* 25 – I work with others but not closely (for example, private office)
* 50 – Slightly close (for example, shared office)
* 75 – Moderately close (at arm’s length)
* 100 – Very close (near touching)

* Exposure to disease is a variable from the O*NET database about the context in which people work, with a value of 0 to 100.

* The standardized exposure to disease or infections measure is defined by:

* 0 – Never 25 – Once a year or more but not every month
* 50 – Once a month or more but not every week
* 75 – Once a week or more but not every day
* 100 – Every day

* The data set obtain an estimate of exposure to disease (generally) and physical proximity for UK occupations using 2019 data.

* For the percentage of female in each occupation, figures have been grouped together for percentages greater than 95% for disclosure reasons and it is recorded as 95%.

* The BAME group includes: Mixed or Multiple ethnic groups, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Chinese or any other Asian background, Black/African/Caribbean/Black British.

* This data set is created by using the Annual Population Survey (APS) January to December 2019.

* Data regarding to some occupations are based on low sample numbers and should be treated with caution and the sample size of some occupations is too small to produce a reliable estimate.
